- Find something interesting in unlabeled data
	- Ex: clustering
- Data comes with inputs $x$, but not output labels $y$
- Algorithm has to find **structure** in the data.

## Clustering
- Group similar data points together.

## Anomaly detection
- Find unusual data points

## Dimensionality reduction
- Compress data using fewer numbers
